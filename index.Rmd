## The App - Exploring government staffing data

Government data is often hard to get into, mostly because entities do large scale data releases and it takes time to get your head around what all that data is. 

This app is designed to segment up a large dataset, making it more digestable by:

1. Splitting it into several datasets
2. Allowing you to view only the variables you select
3. Letting you search for the particular rows you want to view

## How to use it

This app will help you to carry out EDA. You have a lot of data and want to find something - either a number, trend, or a comparison. You are initially overwhemled. You've got some options for helping you get from big to small. 

- Who am I interested in? 1 department? The group as a whole? (Public Service) A typical EDA could go as follows:

```{r opts.label = 'shiny', echo=FALSE}
HRCData <- read.csv('HRCData.csv')
slidifyUI(
        sidebarPanel(
                selectInput('Department', 'Choose Department', as.character(unique(HRCData$Department))
                            )
        )
)
```
- What do I want to know about that group? Staff number, Ethnic information, or other random stats? Explore to get familiar

```{r opts.label = 'shiny', echo=FALSE}
HRCData <- read.csv('HRCData.csv')
slidifyUI(
        sidebarPanel(
                selectInput('Type', 'Choose Type of Stats', c('Staff Number', 'Ethnic Stats', 'Other Stats')))
)
```
- More specifically, what metric/s am I interested in?

```{r opts.label = 'shiny', echo=FALSE}
HRCData <- read.csv('HRCData.csv')
slidifyUI(
        sidebarPanel(
                selectInput('Metric', 'Choose Metric', as.character(names(HRCData))))
)
```

## So what's the point?

After you have made your selections, you should have narrowed down the dataset to a page worth of data - something a lot more manageable for analysis!

## Where it could go

I have built this app specifically for one dataset - it could be built to take any dataset. i.e. make the code generalised to work whatever data you put in. 

An option to download the reduced dataset would also be useful.

Add a visualistion component such as a google motion chart, rCharts or any interactive R visualistion.
